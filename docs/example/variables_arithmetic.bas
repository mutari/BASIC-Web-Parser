1 REM Variables and Arithmetic Example
2 REM This program demonstrates variables and arithmetic operations in BASIC

10 REM Assign values to variables
20 LET A = 5
30 LET B = 10
40 LET NAME = "BASIC"

50 REM Perform arithmetic operations
60 LET SUM = A + B
70 LET DIFFERENCE = B - A
80 LET PRODUCT = A * B
90 LET QUOTIENT = B / A

100 REM Display results
110 PRINT "A = " + A
120 PRINT "B = " + B
130 PRINT "NAME = " + NAME
140 PRINT "SUM (A + B) = " + SUM
150 PRINT "DIFFERENCE (B - A) = " + DIFFERENCE
160 PRINT "PRODUCT (A * B) = " + PRODUCT
170 PRINT "QUOTIENT (B / A) = " + QUOTIENT

180 REM Compound operations
190 LET C = (A + B) * 2
200 PRINT "C = (A + B) * 2 = " + C
